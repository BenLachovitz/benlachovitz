### 👋 Hi there! I'm Ben Lachovitz

I'm a recent Computer Science graduate (B.Sc., GPA 85) passionate about building smart, efficient, and creative software solutions.

🔧 My hands-on project experience includes:
- 🧠 AI integration with LLaMA via the Groq API
- 🕹️ Unity-based simulation & game development (scene generation, object placement, pathfinding)
- 🚀 Simulation tools using C++ and A* search
- 🛠️ Backend tools with Supabase and RESTful APIs

I'm especially interested in full-stack development, AI, and scalable systems — and I love solving tough technical problems.

💼 Currently seeking a full-time developer position where I can contribute, grow, and collaborate with a driven tech team.

**Languages & Tools**:  
Python · C++ · Java · C# · Unity · Supabase · REST APIs · Git
